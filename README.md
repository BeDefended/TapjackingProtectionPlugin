TapjackingProtectionPlugin
==================

Tapjacking is the combination of “tap” and “jacking” and, as the term suggests, it means someone hijacking what a user taps on his smartphone. It is the mobile version of the “Clickjacking” for web applications.

Using social engineering an attacker can develop a malicious app that exploits tapjacking and tricks the victim into doing dispositive actions on vulnerable applications.

This plugin prevents tapjacking attacks by setting the [setFilterTouchesWhenObscured](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setFilterTouchesWhenObscured(boolean)) to true on the main WebView.
In this way Android will discard touches when the WebView is obscured by another visible window. 


Installation

Usage
